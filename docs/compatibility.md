# Compatibility manifest

What runs in zx_go. This is a working document — every entry has a
status, the model it was tested on, and (if "Issue") a brief note.
The list isn't exhaustive; it's the titles a contributor has
specifically loaded and run to a point of confident "works" or
"broken here". To add an entry, follow the protocol at the bottom.

Status legend:
- **Works** — boots to title screen, accepts input, plays.
- **Works (caveat)** — playable but with a known emulator-side
  imperfection. Caveat documented in the Notes column.
- **Parses cleanly** — file-format parser accepts the image
  without error. No gameplay verification.
- **Known issue** — loads partway, crashes, or visibly wrong.
  Filed as a GitHub issue (linked).
- **Untested** — no contributor has run this through yet.

Confidence note: every title below sits on top of the same Z80 core
that passes both Cringle exerciser suites
([zexdoc and zexall](../pkg/z80/testdata/conformance/README.md)).
"Works" therefore means CPU correctness is not under suspicion when
something does go wrong — it's almost always a peripheral or timing
issue. See "Foundation tests" for what blanket-cover tests do and
don't buy you.

## Foundation tests

These integration tests under `pkg/testharness` (and one in
`pkg/plus3fdc`) prove the *foundation* for each category works.
They do **not** prove arbitrary programs in the category run
correctly — they prove the boot path and primary API surface are
sound, which narrows the debug area when a specific title misbehaves.

| Test | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `TestNewBoots48K` (testharness) | The 48K ROM boots and writes screen attribute state — any failure here would indicate a broken core, not a broken title. |
| `TestIF1CATCommand` (testharness) | Interface 1 + Microdrive paging, ROM hooks, and `CAT 1` execution work. Doesn't prove arbitrary IF1 software runs. |
| `TestDiscipleColdBootAndKeypress` (testharness) | DISCiPLE pages in, boots GDOS, and accepts keypresses. Doesn't prove arbitrary GDOS programs run. |
| `TestSaveDSKRoundTrip` (plus3fdc) | +3 disk image parser / writer is symmetric. Doesn't prove arbitrary +3 disk titles boot. |
| `TestNextRealROMBoot` (testharness) | NextZXOS boots through ~10K instructions without crashing. Doesn't prove it reaches the BASIC prompt or any specific Next title runs. |
| `TestModelNextLayer2VisibleEndToEnd` (testharness) | The NextReg → palette → Layer 2 → compositor pipeline produces correct RGBA pixels. Doesn't prove arbitrary Layer 2 demos look right (timing, sprite layering, Copper sync). |
| `TestLoadNEXAgainstRealSample` (testharness) | The .NEX V1.2 parser correctly reads banks 0–7 from a real distro file. Banks ≥8 are silently skipped — `.nex` files using extended banks won't load fully. |
| `TestZexdoc`, `TestZexall` (z80) | Every documented Z80 instruction passes Cringle's exerciser; every undocumented behaviour (F3/F5, MEMPTR/WZ partial, DDCB register-copy) passes too. |

If a title in a covered category fails, the bug is almost certainly
in a peripheral driver, timing, or untested undocumented behaviour —
not the core CPU.

## 48K titles

Canonical 48K titles. None have been individually verified through
zx_go yet; foundation tests confirm the 48K boot path works.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Manic Miner | Untested | |
| Jet Set Willy | Untested | |
| Knight Lore | Untested | Filled 3D — exercises attribute clash handling |
| Atic Atac | Untested | |
| Sabre Wulf | Untested | |
| Skool Daze | Untested | |
| The Hobbit | Untested | |
| Lords of Midnight | Untested | |
| Elite (Spectrum port) | Untested | |
| Chuckie Egg | Untested | |
| Horace Goes Skiing | Untested | |
| Jet Pac (Interface 2 cartridge) | Untested | IF2 cartridge slot wired and tested in `if2_test.go` |
| Pssst (Interface 2 cartridge) | Untested | Same IF2 path as Jet Pac |

## 128K / +2 titles

Titles that use the AY-3-8912 sound chip and/or the extended 128K
memory map. Foundation tests confirm 128K paging works.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Robocop (Ocean) | Untested | AY soundtrack |
| Renegade | Untested | |
| Target: Renegade | Untested | |
| R-Type (Spectrum port) | Untested | |
| Lemmings (Spectrum port) | Untested | |
| Where Time Stood Still | Untested | |
| Head over Heels | Untested | |
| Last Ninja 2 | Untested | |
| Match Day II | Untested | |
| The Way of the Tiger | Untested | |

## +3 / +2A disk titles

Titles distributed on +3 floppy disk. Foundation: `plus3fdc`
DSK / EDSK / UDI round-trip tests prove the disk container code is
symmetric, but no individual +3 title has been loaded and run.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cobra (Ocean, 1986) — +3 disk | Parses cleanly | 194816-byte CPCEMU DSK, 40 tracks, 1 side. Round-trips through `plus3fdc.ParseDiskImage` without errors. Not yet run to gameplay end-to-end. |
| Lemmings (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |
| Where Time Stood Still (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |
| Driller (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |
| Total Eclipse (+3 disk reissue) | Untested | |

If you have a +3 DSK image that isn't listed and you want to add it,
follow the protocol at the bottom of this document.

## Demoscene

Demoscene productions exercise timing-sensitive features —
mid-frame border palette switches, AY register tricks, contention
patterns, multi-loader tape rituals — that the test harness doesn't
cover. Visual + audio inspection is the only verification.

A general note rather than specific titles: zx_go's mid-frame border
tracking (per-scanline, see `pkg/ula`) and AY-3-8912 register
semantics should handle typical demo techniques, but no specific
demo has been run through the full pipeline yet. Spectrum demos worth
trying as stress tests are anything that uses a multicolour technique
(8×1 attribute blocks via raster-synced palette writes), or anything
labelled "intro" or "megademo" from a known group (Triebkraft, Raww
Arse, Mayhem, Lyra) — these are the productions most likely to
expose timing imperfections.

## Spectrum Next titles

The Next boots NextZXOS end-to-end (v1.0 RC1) — see
[docs/spectrum-next.md](spectrum-next.md). Layer 2, palette, .NEX
loader and the NextZXOS menu/Browser/NextBASIC work; sprite polish,
full DAC integration, and several video modes are deferred to v1.1.

| Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Baggers in Space (Stonechat Games) | Untested | Public `.nex` distribution; uses Layer 2 + sprites; foundation: `TestModelNextLayer2VisibleEndToEnd` |

The Next title scene is small enough that any contributor running
public `.nex` releases from specnext.com or itch.io should add their
own rows below as they verify them. **No fabrications** — only list
titles you've actually run.

## Tape format edge cases

The `pkg/ula` tape pipeline supports both TAP (load + save) and TZX
(load + save, blocks 0x10 / 0x11 / 0x14). Edge cases worth verifying
manually:

- **Speedlock / Alkatraz loaders**: turbo blocks with non-standard pilot
  lengths. Format support is present; correct decoding of every
  variant is not exhaustively tested.
- **Multi-side tapes**: side-A side-B "flip the tape" sequences in
  adventure games (Lords of Midnight Vol 1, etc.). Stop Tape from the
  menu and load the next side.
- **Multi-load games (lots of action games)**: ensure the fast tape
  trap doesn't interfere with multi-block loaders; turn it off if so.

## Joystick configurations

Verified by the keymap unit tests (`pkg/keyboard/keyboard_test.go`).
Picking the right joystick for a given game is essential:

- **Kempston** (port 0x1F) — most arcade games of the late 80s
- **Sinclair 1** (keys 1-5) — Sinclair Interface 2 left side; games
  with explicit "Sinclair joystick" support
- **Sinclair 2** (keys 6-0) — right side
- **Cursor / Protek** (keys 5/6/7/8/0) — fewer games; check title
  documentation

## How class evidence works

When a title isn't on the list, you can still predict whether it'll
run by figuring out which class it belongs to:

1. Is it pure 48K BASIC? → `TestNewBoots48K` covers it.
2. Does it use the AY sound chip? → Multi-AY tests cover register
   semantics; if your title uses AY through standard ports, the
   sound will play.
3. Does it use IF1 / Microdrive? → `TestIF1CATWorks` covers the boot
   path.
4. Does it use DISCiPLE / +D? → `TestDISCiPLEBootsIntoGDOS` covers
   the boot path.
5. Does it use +3 disks? → `TestPlus3FDCDiskRoundtrip` covers disk
   I/O.
6. Does it depend on cycle-exact contention (e.g. multicolour
   scanline tricks)? → Open in a hex editor, check whether it does
   raster waiting via T-state loops; if yes, expect potential
   wobble.
7. Is it a Next .NEX file? → Banks 0-7 fully supported; 8-111
   silently skipped today.

## How to add a title

When you load a title and want to record the result:

1. Try the title on the appropriate model (most 48K games stay on
   48K; +3 disk games need +3; etc.).
2. Note any peripheral state required (DISCiPLE on/off, joystick
   selection).
3. Run far enough to confirm the title is functional — not just
   "shows the loading screen" but "playable".
4. Add a row to the appropriate table:
   - **Works** for clean runs.
   - **Works (caveat)** for visible-but-cosmetic issues (audio
     pitch slightly off, etc.).
   - **Known issue** for crashes / corruption / freezes — file a
     GitHub issue first and link it.
5. Submit a PR.

This manifest is the cheapest credibility lever in the project: a
title list with verified statuses is more useful than any number
of internal benchmarks for telling a prospective user "yes, this
works for what you want to do".
